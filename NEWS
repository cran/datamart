datamart Version 0.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  The Mashup class has been rewritten. The changes are not backward compatible. The new
   implementation paves the way to a make-like, declarative data build process.
   
*  The Blogger class has been rewritten in order to use the OAuth2 interface for posting.

*  The InternalData class has been rewritten. The changes are not backward compatible. The
   resource name(s) for dataset is/are now predefined through the dataset name(s). Hence it is
   not possible to set the resource name elsewhere. This was necessary as internal datasets
   may comprise several data entities.
   
*  The Xsparql2 class with its constructor xsparql2 has been renamed to Xsparql/xsparql. At
   this experimental stage, the classes and interfaces are still changing, breaking existing
   code. Hence naming new versions of an idea differently is not necessary in my opinion.
   
*  The UrlData3 class has been renamed to UrlData.

NEW FEATURES

*  a class CsvData for administrating tabular data: an update mechanism, keeping metadata on 
   the dataset and on dataset columns.

MINOR FEATURES

*  New unit sets for area and volume are introduced. Also, the self-tests for the uconv function
   have been revised.

*  New class GoogleOAuth2 which enables connection with Google services such as Blogger. It 
   manages a file with the access token, so that acquiring an access token through authentication 
   is necessary only once.
   
*  New XSPARQL examples on power plants: openei() and enipedia()

*  The gapminder() datamart, which was removed for the last few versions, has returned.

*  improved documentation: partly due to new version of roxygen, partly due to usage of href
   instead of url, added @seealso where appropriate

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

*  removed the unit set for temperature. Since the unit conversion between degree F and degree C 
   is affine but not homogen, it is not easy to fit it in the existing code. May return in later 
   version, but I need to rethink the concept first.
   
*  removed siunit and mySPARQL documentation. These are internal functions.


datamart Version 0.4.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  The data object returned by sourceforge() now has only one resource "SourceforgeStats" and additional parameters
   from and to. The sourceforge() function accepts a optional clss parameter.
   
*  The data object returned by city_coords() now has only one resource "CityCoordinates" and takes additional parameters
   city and country (optional, default DE).

NEW FEATURES

*  A new generic with the name "put" is introduced.

*  A new generic "meta" for Location classes is introduced and implemented for Blogger and DirectoryLocation.


MINOR FEATURES

*  new UrlData3 example netConnectGermany

*  new Mashup / UrlData3 example eurostat_web

*  new UrlData3 example oddsportal

*  Bugfix for uconv, check for valid temperature units added.

*  Bugfix for strsubst, unhelpful error message when one escape sequence is invalid fixed..

*  Fixed test for strsubst. Added minimal first test for uconv.

*  Worked on the documentation, it is still not satisfactory.

*  Moved "Depends" to "Imports", removed dependency on RSQLite package.


DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

*  urldata and urldata2 have been removed. Instead, urldata3 is the way to go. The first official version
   of the package (1.0) will rename urldata3 to urldata.
   
*  The naming "build" was not a good idea and has been removed. It is now called "put".

*  The unitsets CrudeOil and GaseousFuels have been removed. They are now part of "Energy". The code for the "uconv"
   function has been rewritten. 

*  The mauna_loa, tour_de_france, gscholar and gapminder dataset have been removed. First need to look into into it. May return in later versions.

*  The DataStore concept has been removed. The "put" generic will replace that.


datamart Version 0.3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

*  The InternalData function has been rewritten and may behave different to prior versions.

NEW FEATURES

*  A build mechanism with the new generic build is introduced. The build method takes at least a Target object and 
   a Location object. Examples for targets are swvreport and mdreport; examples for locations are DirectoryLocation and Blogger.
   
*  new function uconv to convert between measurement units. 


MINOR FEATURES

*  new UrlData example cityCoords

*  simplified constructor for class DataStoreDriver

*  first tests cases added

*  NEWS file added

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

*  removed function wikisites

datamart Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* new fundamental class UrlData, with examples mauna_loa, iwv_online, be_bathing_water_quality,
  sourceforge, gapminder, tourdefrance 

* new fundamental class Mashup, with experimental example eurostat

* mechanism for persistence, classes DataStoreDriver and SQLiteDataStore with adapted generics, and
  new generics scrape and scrapes

MINOR FEATURES

* class GScholar for querying Google scholar (inherited from UrlData), with example
  statsoft_popularity 

* some string utility functions added, strhead, strtail, strencrypt, strdecrypt, strsubst, strparse, strrecode, strcap

* mem.info introspection function
