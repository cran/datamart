#' Common interface to various data sources.
#'
#' datamart provides several S4 classes to access and cache
#' data sources on the internet or elsewhere. Its aim is
#' to extent the functionality of the data() function by
#' enabling parametrized data requests and offering a
#' data update process.
#'
#' At the heart of datamart are two new methods: With query()
#' you actually use your data source and request some data.
#' With scrape() you curate your data, that is, you may 
#' provide a mechanism to akquire new data. 
#' 
#' The datamart package provides basic infrastructure for
#' the data collection, i.e. the generic methods, and some
#' examples to prove the concept. The package is inspired
#' by the \href{https://bitbucket.org/ScraperWiki/scraperwiki}{scraperwiki project}, 
#' which provides a webbased service for data collection. Also inspiring 
#' are \href{http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/CountryData.html}{Mathematica's xxxData functions}, 
#' which provide in-built parametrizable datasets.
