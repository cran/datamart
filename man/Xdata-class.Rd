\title{Xdata -- A class representing a data source}
\description{
  Most methods of the class are abstract, however the
  \code{show}, \code{print}, \code{queries} methods will
  usually not need to be redefined.
}
\details{
  The \code{query} method is defined for character resource
  arguments. It is tried to transform the argument to an
  object; if that succeeds, \code{query} is called again.
  Derived methods that are also interpreting resource as
  character should first call this method via
  \code{callNextMethod}.
